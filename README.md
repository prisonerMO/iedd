**Improvised Explosive Device Disposal - Handbook**, also known as **IEDD - Handbook** or **IEDD** is an [Arma 3][arma3-link-steam] modification with the goal to make the gameplay and interaction with IEDs more tense, immersive and challenging by providing more inconspicuous objects which can house those IEDs as wwell as more in-depth mechanics like cutting the wires in the right order. It also comes with an in-game handbook item which provides the players in the field with means to identify and defuse these new and challenging hazards safely... *most of the time*.

<!-- To Be added once Guides are done -->
<!-- Also a worthwhile question: Use readme.md files or use a github wiki instead? -->
<!-- You can find more detailed guidance and informations here: ~link-to-somewhere~ -->

**IEDD - Handbook** is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version as long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the <a href="LICENSE.txt">GNU General Public License</a>.
