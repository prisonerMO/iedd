**Improvised Explosive Device Disposal - Notebook**, also known as **IEDD - Notebook** or **IEDD** is an [Arma 3][arma3-link-steam] modification with the goal to make the gameplay and interaction with IEDs more tense, immersive and challenging by providing more inconspicuous objects which can house those IEDs as wwell as more in-depth mechanics like cutting the wires in the right order. It also comes with an in-game notebook item which provides the players in the field with means to identify and defuse these new and challenging hazards safely... *most of the time*.

<!-- To Be added once Guides are done -->
